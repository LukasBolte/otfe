"5fb7dd473afbb1033b491811","I thought I did much better, but only received a bit more than $11, which is a decent amount less than the $16 average. I feel the pay is fair though, even only receiving $11!",10,10,7,8

"6699469d177ba339d6c4648b","Everything went smoothly in this study. I am actually confused about the tax rate now, because the study told me I was to receive a 50% tax cut for the rest of the study, but I answered 50% on study 3 and hypothetical 4 and got no bonus. Perhaps I read something wrong.",4,5,5,5
"5c6a36214fbf270001311702","5 stars and flawless! I'm so sorry but I did not notice the button to proceed for the 5 practice exercises until much later. I continued to decipher because I thought it would automatically stop after 5. Thank you for the opportunity, it was such a fun study fand a pleasure participating.  After this exercise, I'm now interested in learning Greek and just added it to my Duolingo account!",10,9,10,10
"5fa4c21a04bc5912180291bc",":-)    i would be happy knowing, if there were others who were taxed higher, and more often, than i had    i could only wish, i was allowed to employ Backspace to strike mistakes    also: a task like this, couldn't be considered *strictly* an assessment of one's skill in transcribing  or, even, visual acuity    as, there was an element of Manual Dexterity at play, also: in determining the rate at which one could get those greeks in the field",10,10,10,10
