<p>
  We want to know what taxes you expect. 
</p>

<p>
  Hence, we will ask you questions like: "What tax rate do you expect on your earnings this coming work period and other future work periods?"
 </p>

 <p>
  We will ask you before each work period. 
 </p>

 <p>
  If your answer is "sufficiently close" to the true average tax rate participants like yourself—who read the same instructions—face, you will be paid a bonus of ${{ C.BELIEF_BONUS }}.
</p>

<p>
  By "sufficiently close," we mean within 2.5 percentage points of the true average tax rate. For example, if the true average tax rate is 25%, a "sufficiently close" response would be between 22.5% and 27.5%.
</p>

<p>
  Do not worry if you feel you do not have enough information to answer the questions. They are meant to be ambiguous.
