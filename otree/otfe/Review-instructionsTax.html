<p>
  We will "tax" you on earnings from the work tasks. 
</p>

<p>
  Your default tax rate will be 25%. 
</p>

<p>
  However, with some probability, the tax rate may change.
</p>

<p>
  If the tax rate stays at 25%, then for every $1 you earn, you would keep 75 cents, and we will keep the remaining 25 cents. 
</p>

<p>
  After each work task, we will inform you of your:
  <ul>
      <li>initial gross earnings (before we tax them)</li>
      <li>tax rate</li>
      <li>after-tax earnings</li>
  </ul>
</p>
