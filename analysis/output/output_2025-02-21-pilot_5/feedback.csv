Perhaps I read something wrong.",4,5,5,5

After this exercise, I'm now interested in learning Greek and just added it to my Duolingo account!",10,9,10,10

"5de7b588ff15c2a06658dd1d","""A correctly transcribed line required 5 or fewer mistakes""  This direction, which I quoted exactly is FALSE.  A SINGLE MISTAKE eliminates the work.  It seemed fishy as I was going and then I tested it in the 3rd round.  When you LIE about the basic premise of the work it makes the entire thing invalid for research.  I suggest FIXING the directions.  If this is caught before publication it could invalidate your research.  Seriously.  Additionally. 9 bucks for an hour of work is underpaid.  You estimated 16 i didn't come close but worked hard and efficiently the whole time. I would call your estimation misleading.",1,1,1,1
