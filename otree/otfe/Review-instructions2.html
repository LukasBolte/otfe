  Each work period will last {{ C.WORK_PERIOD_LENGTH }}  minutes. You will not be able to move on to the next part of the study before the {{ C.WORK_PERIOD_LENGTH }} minutes are over.

  It is up to you how much you want to work; you may decide to do something else for part of the {{ C.WORK_PERIOD_LENGTH }}  minutes, or you may decide to work throughout. For example, you may want to complete only a few tasks (or none at all!) and instead spend some time doing other things like checking your mail or watching YouTube videos. That is perfectly fine; you will always receive the participant fee, no matter what.
