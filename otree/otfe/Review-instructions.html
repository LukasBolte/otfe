  In this study, you will complete simple work tasks!
</p>

<p>
  There will be 3 (three) work periods of duration {{ C.WORK_PERIOD_LENGTH }} minutes each during which you can earn money for each task completed. We will "tax" some of these earnings. We will discuss this tax later.
</p>

<p>
  The work task will consist of transcribing images of handwritten Greek text. You will be shown an image of Greek text and asked to click keys on a displayed keyboard to transcribe the text. You are not required to have any prior knowledge of the Greek language.
</p>

<p>
  You will receive a pay rate of {{ C.ROW_PAYMENT }} cents per row correctly transcribed. A correctly transcribed line requires five or fewer mistakes. This payment is in addition to the participation fee you will earn simply by completing the experiment and other in-experiment payments.
</p>

<p> 
  You can complete as many transcription tasks as you would like during each work period. As soon as you complete a transcription task, a new transcription task will appear.
