        Past US presidential administrations and campaigns have announced their intention to eliminate student debt <i>only</i> among those with outstanding student loan debt. These plans would not, on their own, have eliminated student debt entirely for all students in the future.

        Continue supposing that you or a family member were attending university in the near future.

    <p class="question">
        <b>Question 2</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Some countries have implemented one-time wealth taxesâ€”taxes on real and/or financial assets that only apply for a single year.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, in 2013, the government of Cyprus decided to implement a one-time tax on all domestic bank account deposits above a fixed amount at a rate of up to 9.9%. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As another example, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the government of Argentina decided to implement a one-time wealth tax on high-wealth individuals at a rate of 3.5% of their assessed wealth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the scenario where your government implemented one of these taxes in the recent past. To be clear, this kind of tax would only affect your <i>wealth</i> (e.g., stocks you own, money held in bank accounts, etc.). Your work pay would not be directly affected by the tax.
